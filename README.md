# ReservationApp

To run the app just clone the repo to a new project in intellij idea IDE. Then find a file called pom.xml. Right click this file and select maven -> reload project. Intellij will probably notify you that a maven file is located and it will ask you if you want to load it.
The app needs a database i used postgresql. To add a database just configure your application.properties file so it looks like the application.properties.example file that i provided in this repo.
